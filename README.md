# ulutil

This is a collection of utilities I found useful during the course of my
research in the Church lab.  It is an upstream dependency for the `vdj`
package, and was used to make lots of figures, etc.

### Installation

```bash
pip install ulutil
```

or

```bash
git clone https://github.com/churchlab/ulutil.git
cd ulutil
python setup.py install
```

There may be varied dependencies for the different submodules.
